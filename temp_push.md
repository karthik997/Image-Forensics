# **Introduction**

### What is Cyber Forensics ?

Cyber Forensics is a science which deals with techniques used to track the **footprints** left behind a cyber attack.
Cyber forensics is directly linked to any cyber crime which has data loss and recovery. Some examples include investigation on possible **forged digital signatures, authehticity of images, analysis of malicious software** etc.

Let us go into more detail of the definition from a CTF perspective. Any Capture The Flag contest usually has three prime categories of digital forensics.
They are:

  1. Network Forensics
  2. Image Forensics
  3. Memory Forensics

# **Scope of Forensics** 

When we talk about employment, research or anything, Cyber Forensics is one of the prime areas which comes into a security analyst's mind.
Forensics is strongly employed in **Incident Response, Malware Analysis, Data leak protection**. Actually to sum it up, every cyber crime is always related to cyber forensics.

To understand this, let us look at the trend of cyber attacks based on the analysis from January 2017-2018:

Cyber crimes are at 77% in 2017

Now let us look at January 2018:

So as you can see, the percentage has increased to a alarming rate.

So folks, I hope you understand just how import cyber forensics is in the current world of information security.

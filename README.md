# **Introduction**

### What is Cyber Forensics ?

Cyber Forensics is a science which deals with techniques used to track the **footprints** left behind a cyber attack.
Cyber forensics is directly linked to any cyber crime which has data loss and recovery. Some examples include investigation on possible **forged digital signatures, authehticity of images, analysis of malicious software** etc.

Let us go into more detail of the definition from a CTF perspective. Any Capture The Flag contest usually has three prime categories of digital forensics.
They are:

  1. Network Forensics
  2. Image Forensics
  3. Memory Forensics

# **Scope of Forensics** 

When we talk about employment, research or anything, Cyber Forensics is one of the prime areas which comes into a security analyst's mind.
Forensics is strongly employed in **Incident Response, Malware Analysis, Data leak protection**. Actually to sum it up, every cyber crime is always related to cyber forensics.

To really understand this, let us look into a very dangerous virus attack which almost started world war III.
**Stuxnet** was a virus which was found lurking in the systems which controlled nuclear centrifuges in Iran.
Stuxent had a stolen yet officially authorised digital signature which acted as a very good camouflage. Stuxnet made the windows systems constantly reboot or lead them to **Blue Screen of Death**. Stuxnet could easily affect any computer which was linked to the network. It was really difficult for security experts to trace it. It severely affected the **SCADA systems** which were employed in maintaing the rotation speed of the centrifuges.
After heavy investigation, when several forensic analysts looked into the SCADA network transfer, they found a malicious program being run which altered the system processes. The main aspect which made stuxnet almost invisible was that it became active only when it's target was present or being run. Until then the virus remained dormant.
So as you can see, Cyber forensics played a huge role in the detection of the virus.

Let us look at the trend of cyber attacks based on the analysis from January 2017-2018:

Some handy definitions:

1. Cyber Espionage: Use of computer networks to get access to confidential information held by important organizations.

2. Hacktivism : Act of hacking which are mainly done for a political purpose.

3. Cyber Warfare : Cyber attacks done on state organizations to gain military secrets etc.

Cyber crimes are at 77% in 2017

Now let us look at January 2018:

So as you can see, the percentage has increased to a alarming rate.

So folks, I hope you understand just how important cyber forensics is in the current world of cyber security.
